# CV-Application-Project

## What I learned 

- Writing and constructing class components with react, and trying to start thinking about my organisation in terms of react components.

- Learning and considering where to store the state of my application, whether it needs to be in the parent or child component of the app. 

- Displaying my HTML using JSX and use conditional rendering to render specific elements based on state.

## How I could improve moving forward

- Figuring out how to place state in the right place. The component that stores the state generally needs to be responsible for editing that state. I want to try to avoid excessive prop drilling.
